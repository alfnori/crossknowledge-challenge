# CrossKnowledge Test - Adolfo Luiz

All the tests are using the proposed original components, with a few changes. Some features or assets are there to replicate the expect result.

### 1 - Cache function

It was implemented on [request.php](request.php), using the proposed library to connect to Redis. It's using a default installation configuration to connect and execute a cache logic inside method **'makeRequest'**. To illustrate the caching function, there is a test file ([request-test.php](request-test.php)) that could be used.

### 2 - Date formatting

It was implemented on [date-format.html](date-format.html). Each time that the original code appends a new div, the function **'jsDateFormat'** will be called. This function is responsible for calculate the pasting time after the creation's moment of each div. 

### 3 - Apply style

It was implemented on [component.html](component.html). No html was added except for some classes and imported stylesheet. The BEM methodology has been followed. All CSS are in the file [assets/main.css](assets/main.css). A normalizer was used to ensure compatibility. The original poster image was replaced for one with a better resolution.

### 4 - Question

The answers about REST are in the file [question.md](question.md).

## Final Considerations 

* Any contact can be done by email at alfnori@gmail.com or phone/WhatsApp at **(41)98873-0745**
* I'm sorry for the test's delay. Last couple of weeks weren't easy for me, I had two other tests that were already late to be finished and sent before starting this one.
* If the jobs are already taken, please review my profile again when a new demand comes up.
* Thank you for the opportunity.
